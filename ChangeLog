   carry the node name. Do accept profiles that have
   at least one of login-name, node-name or tailnet-name.
 * added tests for all authnz providers.
 * Implemented authorization provider 'tailscale-node'.
 * Implemented authorization provider 'tailscale-tailnet'.
 * Added caching behaviour for tailscale whois information,
   kept per connection for 1 second by default. Configurable
   via `AuthTailscaleCacheTimeout` directive.
 * Implemented authorization provider 'tailscale-user'.

   `AuthType tailscale` is configured, the login name of the
   tailscale user is set.
